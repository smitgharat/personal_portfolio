      <h3>Amazon Clone Website</h3>
      <p>
        Synopsis: The Amazon Clone Website is my inaugural web development project, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and fundamental JavaScript. It offers a comprehensive replication of the renowned Amazon.in home page, providing users with a detailed and immersive experience. The website encompasses a multitude of interactive elements, including buttons, icons, and an enticing image slider that adds a touch of realism. Through meticulous attention to detail, I aimed to recreate the user-friendly interface and captivating design that Amazon.in is known for.

      <h3>Student Assignment Management Software System - Trees</h3>
      <p>
        Synopsis: The Student Assignment Management Software System was developed in 20 days using the C programming language, with a focus on using B-trees as the data structure. The system is designed as a menu-driven program that serves as an interface between students and teachers. Students can form groups of two and upload their assignments. Teachers can use the system to check if all students have submitted a particular assignment, view students' status regarding a specific assignment, evaluate assignments, update marks, and display ordered lists based on marks. Additionally, the system provides features such as range traversal and includes file handling capabilities.
